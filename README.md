## Trip Duration Estimator developed in Flask with  LGBM Regression model trained on large dataset and deployed into a Flask App for inference

** A Flask web app is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for making predictions. The app is designed to be intuitive and not overwhelm users with unnecessary details (like longitude and latitude). And this highlights my Feature Engineering and modelling skills.

# Overview
This web app is built to predict the duration of taxi trips using a LightGBM regression model. The model is trained on a dataset of taxi trip records, and it can estimate the trip duration based on various features like pickup date and time and distance.
The Machine Learning part of this project is in my this repository - https://github.com/aiotsir/LGBM-Trip-Duration-Prediction-ML


## Usage
Open the app in your web browser.
Enter relevant details, such as pickup date and time and distance.
Click the "Predict Trip Duration" button to get the estimated trip duration.
